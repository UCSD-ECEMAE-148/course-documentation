## About this course

ECE/MAE 148 is a highly popular technical elective course for Engineering students across both disciplines. In this class you will receive invaluable hands-on experience in project-based learning as you work in teams to design, build and program a 1:10 scale robot vehicle capable of performing different tasks while autonomously driving, from simulation to deployment on your real, physical car. This won't be your usual classroom experience in that a majority of your learning will come from **getting your hands dirty** as opposed to written assignment exercises. 

In 148, your success is contingent upon your willingness to put in the minimum time expected for a 4-unit class, and then some. For example, if your team consists of 4 members, that's **40 hours per week** in combined team efforts to reach your objectives. In return, you will walk away with a set of real, crucial skills to set you apart from everyone else when it comes time for graduate school or career applications; in short, it's well worth it, and you'll have *a lot of fun doing it*.
