# Introductions and Class Logistics

## Instruction Team
- Jack Silberman - [jacks@eng.ucsd.edu](mailto:jacks@eng.ucsd.edu) - PhD, Faculty MAE, ECE and HDSI
- TBD - email - TA/Tutor

## Safety
- Follow the return to learn, that simple
    - Lab access. Please observe UCSD’s safety guidelines - Compliance with required trainings.
    - Be safe, ask for help; don’t be afraid to test things but be safe. You are in school to learn, you are supposed to have help.

## Adapting to Changes
- For the past 5+ years, more than 1/2 of you would not be in this class. ***Be patient with us***.
    - We expanded it from 28 to 60 students, 7 to 15 Teams.
    - This means we had to find a space to fit all of you in a lab environment. *Please help by not talking at the same time as the instructional team.*
- We basically have double of the workload with the same resources.
    - Do your part and be patient when things don’t work. Do some hacking and look for solutions with us. **Don’t expect solutions given to you without doing some work too.**
- We are using cutting-edge technology; *it may cut us a bit while we master it.*

## Logistics
- Lectures and times are mixed since we do hands-on lab within the lectures.
    - Tuesdays and Thursdays: **5:30 - 6:50 PM**
        - Office hours at the lab: 7:00 - 8:30 PM
    - Additional office hours TBD as needed
- If needed, access to EBUII 339 TritonAI lab TBD with TA
- Discord for communication, Professor Silberman will share the invite link
- Assignments will be posted on Discord channels
    - Video evidence of course deliverables to be shared on Discord
- See *Grading Formula*
- Top requests from past quarters
    - More time for final project
    - Help on Python coding
    - More structure on "what" and "when"
- **This is a 4 credit class.** If you cannot dedicate 10 hours per week, please consider giving a chance to the dozens of other students on the waiting list. If you put in the effort, you will be successful.
- This class is hands-on-fun-busy where you will gain *highly useful skills to add to your resume.*
- There are no exams or lists of exercises to work on.
    - Your time will be used learning new skills that can make you **stand out** on job or graduate school applications.
    - There are two 360 evaluations where your teammates will judge you. Also, other teams can help on your grade. More on that in grading formula.
- CBT / e-book license on Robot Ignite Academy (The Construct) is required. You have homework already.
